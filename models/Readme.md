# Infinity Engine File Formats Models

Please read [Infinity Engine File Formats](https://gibberlings3.github.io/iesdp/file_formats/index.htm)

## Binrw

This crate heavily relies on [binrw](https://github.com/jam1garner/binrw), see [here](https://docs.rs/binrw/0.14.0/binrw/docs/attribute/index.html) for the macro magic.

## Write/Read

These structures should be able to be written to json and to binary without changing the original file layout in bytes.

## Fixtures

Are not owned by me, all rights reserved for the original owners of the files, beamdog at the time of writing is the current owner of Baldur's Gate IP. The fixtures files are not packaged into the final executable.
