  "contents": "Your history is nearly as unknown as your future, and the things that are certain seem more fancy than fact. As unlikely as it may seem, you have the blood of a deity coursing through your veins.\n\nYou are a product of the Time of Troubles, a cataclysmic period when the gods were made flesh and forced to walk the earth among their followers. One such deity foresaw both the event and his inevitable death because of it, and so took steps to effect his resurrection. This god strode the land before he was made to, and in his wake left a score of mortal progeny driven to conquer and rule. They were not intended to be his successors, but rather the fuel for his rebirth. Heroes would rise to counter these tyrants, and when their evil fell, it would fall to the father.\n\nThe god was Bhaal, Lord of Murder, and you are one of his children.\n\nYou were cared for as a child by Gorion, a powerful wizard that may have had even more powerful friends. It was his influence that allowed you to spend your youth in the library fortress of Candlekeep, where the resident monks schooled you in your skills. Children were an oddity at the keep, though you did have a friend in Imoen. She seemed a kindred spirit, though you knew no more of her background than your own. Gorion never explained how you or she came to be there, or why you needed such a secluded home. It was only after his death that you learned the truth about your bloodline, when you were forced into conflict with his killer, another child of Bhaal.\n\nSarevok was this sibling's name, and he had embraced his foul origins, determined to exploit them and become the next Lord of Murder. He sought to create death on a massive scale, a war of sacrifice that would prove his claim to his father's throne. You unraveled his carefully wrought plans, and ultimately it was you that took his life, sending his taint back to Bhaal. A victory of sorts...\n\nNow you face an uncertain future. A child of murder, you have a lineage that will tempt the ignorant to fear you and the unscrupulous to use you. And always the essence of Bhaal is within, exerting its dark pull when you are weakest. Which is the greater fear: Losing your life to fuel the fire, or losing your will and becoming it?"
